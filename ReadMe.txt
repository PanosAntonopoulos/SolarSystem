Hello,

To run the simulation, Please open the python files "FinalProject.py" and "Test.py", the latter runs the former.

Once you have clicked the run button on my program, two figures will appear. The figure with the animation and a figure with the energy conservation graph. 
The figure with the energy conservation graph will be on top of the animation. 
To see the animation, please just drag the energy conservation graph to the left/right etc but don't close it, this is because occasionally (for my laptop at least) if I close the energy graph then the animation stops, I believe this is just a glitch. This only happens sometimes but if it happens to you then please just re-run the simulation.

Also, it has happened a couple of times that the animation figure shows up but nothing is being animated, again, this is only sometimes and I think could just be a problem with my laptop (MacBook Pro 2017) but as before, if this happens to you, please just close the figures and re-run the code.

Many thanks! :)
